# NAICS Data Cleaning Project

## Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset containing information about NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) codes, industry descriptions, and size standards for businesses. The goal of this project is to demonstrate essential data cleaning skills.

## Skills Demonstrated

1. **Data Import**
   - The project begins by importing data from an Excel file using the `pandas` library.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - The dataset's structure and characteristics are examined, including data types, null values, and summary statistics.

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Various data cleaning operations are performed, including filtering out irrelevant data, creating new columns, and handling missing values.

4. **String Manipulation**
   - String manipulation techniques, such as slicing and replacing values, are used to extract meaningful information from text data.

5. **Data Appending**
   - Data is appended to the DataFrame, a common operation when consolidating or adding new records to an existing dataset.

6. **Data Export**
   - The cleaned dataset is exported to a CSV file, which is essential for preserving the cleaned data for future analysis.
